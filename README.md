# Criminal Network Analysis  
Toy criminal/fraud analysis topic in which a collection of texts is used to identify a criminal organization (named POK here) responsible for a kidnapping.  

### Methodology
Unstructured text data was paired with tabular employment information to create a detailed network analysis of island residents who have some connection - criminal or not - to the fictional kidnapping. Connections to the criminal organization were then identified by pairing network centrality metrics with topic and/or sentiment modeling of text correspondence.
